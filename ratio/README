Compute the ratios.
Python scripts for section Experiment of the article.

For each class 3 result are obtained:
For each class one script for 3 results: CLASSNAME_ratio.py

-- Result 1: RIC/WIC/NIC epsilon context: Table 1 of the article
-the result file is: CLASSNAME_table.csv
-the categroy specific/no-specific/weak-specific is based on the ratio: nb same as \ nb all pair (last column of the csv)
-RIC: ratio > 0.8
-NIC: ratio < 0.2
-WIC: 0.2 >= ratio > 0.8 
 
-- Result 2: specific/no-specific/weak-specific EMCs: Table 2 of the article
- the result file is: CLASSNAME_barchart_detail.csv
- the category representative/no-representative is based on the nb same as \ nb all pair (last colum of the csv  
- representative: ratio > 0.8
- no-representative: ratio < 0.8

-- Result3: owl:sameAs pair distribution: barcharts of the article.
-- the result file is: CLASSNAME_barchart.csv
-- the column "nb sameas > 0.8/all sameas" give the proportion of owl:sameAs belonging to specfic EMCs.
-- the figures are in /figures
